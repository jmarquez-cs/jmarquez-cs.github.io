# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built with Vite.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run Locally (Development)

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your site will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or another port if 5000 is in use).

### 3. Build for Production

To create optimized production files in the `dist` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for easy deployment to GitHub Pages.

To build and deploy your site:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

**Important:** After the first deployment, go to your GitHub repository settings, navigate to "Pages", and ensure the source is set to the `gh-pages` branch.

Your site will then be live at `https://jmarquez-cs.github.io/`.
