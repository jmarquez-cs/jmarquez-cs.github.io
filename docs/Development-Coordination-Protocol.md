# Development Coordination Protocol

Copy-paste ready coordination prompts for systematic React portfolio development following chronological phase strategy.

## Validation Framework Prompts

### Prompt V1: Phase Validation Gate Setup
```
Create comprehensive validation gate system for React portfolio phases. Implement automated testing checkpoints validating performance metrics (60fps animations, sub-2s load times), accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA), and functionality preservation. Include Jest test suites, Lighthouse CI integration, and validation reporting dashboard. Each gate must pass before phase progression with clear pass/fail criteria and automated rollback triggers for failed validations.

Validation targets: Performance budgets maintained, accessibility standards met, core functionality preserved, error boundaries operational.
```

### Prompt V2: Cross-Phase Dependency Validation
```
Implement dependency validation system ensuring Phase 1 infrastructure supports Phase 2 features and Phase 2 stability enables Phase 3 production hardening. Create dependency matrix tracking component relationships, performance impact analysis, and integration point validation. Include automated testing for dependency changes and impact assessment tools for modification planning.

Validation scope: Component integration integrity, performance baseline preservation, API contract compliance, state management compatibility.
```

### Prompt V3: Performance Regression Detection
```
Create automated performance regression detection system monitoring bundle size, render performance, and user interaction responsiveness. Implement baseline establishment, continuous monitoring, and alert systems for performance degradation. Include memory leak detection, animation frame rate monitoring, and loading time tracking with automated reporting.

Detection criteria: Bundle size increases >10%, frame rate drops below 55fps, loading time increases >200ms, memory usage growth >20%.
```

## Error Handling & Rollback Prompts

### Prompt R1: Automated Rollback System
```
Implement comprehensive rollback system for failed phase implementations. Create automated backup creation before major changes, component-level rollback capabilities, and state preservation during rollbacks. Include rollback validation testing, data integrity preservation, and user experience continuity maintenance during recovery procedures.

Rollback triggers: Failed validation gates, performance regression detection, critical error boundary activation, accessibility compliance failures.
```

### Prompt R2: Error Boundary Enhancement System
```
Enhance error boundary system with phase-specific error handling, graceful degradation strategies, and user feedback mechanisms. Implement error categorization, automatic recovery attempts, and fallback component rendering. Include error reporting, user notification systems, and development debugging tools.

Error handling scope: Component failures, async operation errors, performance degradation, accessibility violations, state corruption.
```

### Prompt R3: Development Safety Framework
```
Create development safety framework preventing destructive changes during phase implementation. Implement change validation, impact assessment, and safety checkpoints. Include automated backup systems, change tracking, and recovery procedures with comprehensive logging and audit trails.

Safety measures: Pre-change validation, automated backups, change impact analysis, recovery testing, audit logging.
```

## Cross-Phase Management Prompts

### Prompt M1: Phase Transition Management
```
Implement phase transition management system ensuring smooth progression between development phases. Create transition validation, prerequisite verification, and handoff procedures. Include phase completion criteria, transition testing, and documentation requirements with automated validation workflows.

Transition criteria: All prompts completed successfully, validation gates passed, documentation updated, performance targets achieved.
```

### Prompt M2: Component Integration Coordination
```
Create component integration coordination system managing dependencies across phase implementations. Implement integration testing, compatibility validation, and version management. Include component relationship tracking, impact analysis, and integration verification with automated testing.

Integration scope: Component dependencies, prop contracts, state sharing, event coordination, performance impact assessment.
```

### Prompt M3: Development Workflow Orchestration
```
Implement development workflow orchestration managing daily development cycles, prompt execution sequencing, and progress tracking. Create workflow automation, task prioritization, and completion validation with comprehensive reporting and metrics collection.

Workflow elements: Daily standup automation, prompt execution tracking, validation scheduling, progress reporting, metrics dashboard.
```

## Testing Criteria Prompts

### Prompt T1: Comprehensive Testing Framework
```
Create comprehensive testing framework covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing for React portfolio phases. Implement automated test execution, coverage reporting, and continuous integration. Include accessibility testing, performance testing, and visual regression testing with automated reporting.

Testing coverage: Component functionality, user interactions, accessibility compliance, performance metrics, visual consistency.
```

### Prompt T2: Accessibility Compliance Testing
```
Implement accessibility compliance testing framework ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA standards throughout development phases. Create automated accessibility auditing, manual testing procedures, and compliance reporting. Include screen reader testing, keyboard navigation validation, and color contrast verification.

Compliance testing: Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, color contrast ratios, ARIA implementation, focus management.
```

### Prompt T3: Performance Validation Testing
```
Create performance validation testing framework monitoring application performance throughout development phases. Implement automated performance testing, benchmark comparison, and regression detection. Include load testing, stress testing, and mobile performance validation.

Performance metrics: Bundle size optimization, render performance, animation frame rates, loading times, memory usage patterns.
```

## Implementation Coordination Prompts

### Prompt I1: Daily Development Coordination
```
Implement daily development coordination system managing prompt execution, validation scheduling, and progress tracking. Create automated standup procedures, task prioritization, and completion verification with comprehensive reporting and metrics collection for systematic development progression.

Coordination elements: Morning validation checks, prompt execution tracking, evening progress review, metrics dashboard, next-day preparation.
```

### Prompt I2: Documentation Synchronization
```
Create documentation synchronization system ensuring all implementation changes update relevant documentation automatically. Implement change tracking, documentation validation, and sync verification with automated updates to ComponentInteractionDiagram and architectural documentation.

Documentation scope: Component diagrams, integration patterns, implementation decisions, lessons learned, architectural changes.
